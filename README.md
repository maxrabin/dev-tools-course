# Introduction
This project is the companion to the Made In Jerusalem Side Project Academy course
on Developer Tools. In each lecture we will learn about a different tool useful
in the day to day work of a software developer. These tools somewhat build
on each other, some more than others.

Each lecture will have an assignment associated with it, described below.


# Homework

## Lesson 1 - The Shell
* If you're on Windows 10:
 * [Install WSL|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10]
 * [Install Ubuntu|https://www.microsoft.com/en-il/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6]
 * [Install Windows Terminal|https://www.microsoft.com/en-il/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701]
* Navigate around the shell:
 * Go into directories
 * Go up out of them
 * Create new directories
 * Delete them
* Become Root then exit Root back to your user
* Learn about the `ls` command by running `man ls`. How do you list the contents of your Downloads directory
   sorted by least recently modified?
* Use the `find` command to find all documents of a particular type (choose whichever file type you want)
   in your home folder
* Install `ack` and run `ack <phrase>` to search your code for a phrase you expect to find your code (eg. "main"
   or `if`
* Repeat the `ls` command from before by using <Ctrl>+<R> to search your history
